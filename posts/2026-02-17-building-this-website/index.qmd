## Introduction

I recently transitioned my CV website from Jekyll to Quarto, a modern scientific and technical publishing system. This post describes the process and rationale behind the migration.

## Why Quarto?

Quarto offers several advantages for academic and scientific websites:

1. **Unified authoring**: Create documents, presentations, websites, and books using the same system
2. **Multiple language support**: Works seamlessly with R, Python, Julia, and Observable
3. **Professional themes**: Built-in themes optimized for readability
4. **Blog support**: Easy to add and manage blog posts
5. **Academic-friendly**: Excellent support for citations, equations, and code

## Setting Up the Website

### Project Structure

The Quarto website uses a simple structure:

```
.
├── _quarto.yml          # Main configuration file
├── index.qmd            # CV homepage
├── blog.qmd             # Blog listing page
├── posts/               # Blog posts directory
│   └── 2026-02-17-building-this-website/
│       └── index.qmd
└── styles.css           # Custom styling
```

### Configuration

The `_quarto.yml` file defines the website structure, including navigation, theme, and output settings. I chose the Cosmo theme for its clean, modern appearance.

### Creating Content

Each page is written in Quarto markdown (`.qmd` files), which supports:

- Standard markdown formatting
- YAML metadata headers
- Code blocks with execution
- Mathematical equations
- Cross-references and citations

## Automated Deployment

To automatically deploy the website to GitHub Pages whenever I push changes, I set up a GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Installs Quarto
3. Renders the website
4. Deploys the generated files to GitHub Pages

The entire process is automated and requires no manual intervention.

## Customization

I added custom CSS to enhance the visual presentation, particularly for the contact information and overall spacing. The website maintains a professional appearance suitable for academic purposes while remaining easy to navigate.

## Conclusion

Quarto provides an excellent platform for academic websites. The combination of simplicity, power, and automated deployment makes it ideal for maintaining a personal website alongside research blogging. The transition from Jekyll was straightforward, and the result is a more maintainable and feature-rich website.

## Next Steps

Future improvements I'm considering:

- Adding a publications page
- Creating posts about my research projects
- Integrating interactive visualizations using Observable
- Adding a resources section for lab protocols and code
